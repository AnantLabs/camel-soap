= Introduction =

_camel-soap_ is an Apache Camel component that provides support for zero-code SOAP requests from Camel Routes. 

Camel distro already provides the excellent camel-cxf component. CXF component is very nice and powerful but the implementation of a SEI is mandatory. In some cases it is more convenient to call web services based only on the WSDL. 

Right now camel-soap is a producing only component which means it is not possible to create endpoints inside the from() method in camel routes. 

= Using camel-soap =

camel-soap is a maven based project but it is not yet available in any maven public repository. To include camel-soap in your project you need to download the source code and build it running the command:

$ mvn install

If the previous command run with no errors the camel-soap component will be installed in your maven local repository and can be added to your project pom.xml as a dependency:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.wfreitas</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-soap</artifactId>
  <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
